# Mountain Dulcimer Tools for Musescore
This repository contains plugins and tools to help produce Appalachian Mountain Dulcimer TAB from a Standard Musical Notation (SMN) staff.

If you are here you probably already know that Musescore does not support the odd 'half-fret' numbering convention used by the Mountain Dulcimer community. Indeed, as far as I know the only software to support Mountain Dulcimer TAB is the program TablEdit. If you think in, arrange in, or compose in Mountain Dulcimer half-fret numbering then you most definitely should purchase and use [TablEdit](https://tabledit.com/). If you are already a Musescore user with a need to produce some Mountain Dulcimer TAB; or you think, transcribe and arrange in SMN but need to then create Mountain Dulcimer TAB for your printed score output then these tools can help you.
